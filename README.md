# EcoEats

## 💡 Inspiration
* ☀️Climate Change: We need to find ways to lower our carbon footprint. Food is one way to do so, but people need help finding sustainably produced food/products that also taste good. 
* 👥 Surveys: Making healthy/vegan/sustainably produced products taste better so more people would want to eat foods that better our environment. And surveys are known to help increase customer satisfaction because they have a say in what needs to be implemented into the food /product/service.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦Lines: No one likes waiting in lines. Now, with Covid-19 it's not safe to stay in populated areas for long times. And lines are usually don't abide by the 6 feet rule either.

## 🌱 What it does
* 🛒 Find stores/supermarkets in the area that offer delivery and/or contactless delivery.
* 🌽 Also, stores/supermarkets offer sustainably produced products.
* 🗣 Take surveys and gain points on the taste, packaging, views on these sustainably produced products to help companies make these healthy options more appealing to the world.
* 📊 Lastly, profile view. To show you your weekly grocery overview: how many items were locally produced, seasonal products, your lowest and highest carbon footprint product. It will also contain a graph with your yearly carbon footprint by month and then the current month your in with days.
